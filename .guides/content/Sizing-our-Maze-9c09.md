The first thing we will do is to control the size of our maze game.

We already know that the maze uses a coordinate system. We can specify the width and the height of the maze by using 2 variables

- mazeWidth
- mazeHeight

On the left, we have only 3 instructions available to us

- Variable
- Value (the small blue square with)
- Create Maze

What we need to do is 

1. Drag in a variable block 
2. Choose a variable name and enter it in the space (you can only use mazeWidth and mazeHeight at the moment)
3. Assign that variable name a value by connecting the value block to it.

So, to set mazeWidth to 15, it would look like this.

Once you're done, add the Create Maze block to the end, then press the reload button.
