The first thing we will do is to control the size of our maze game.

We already know that the maze uses a coordinate system. We can specify the width and the height of the maze by using 2 variables

- width
- height

On the left, we've got 3 blocks available to us

- var (which helps you create a variable)
- A number value (the small blue square with a '0' in it)
- Create Empty Maze

What we need to do is 

1. Drag in a variable block 
1. Choose a variable name and enter it in the space (you can only use mazeWidth and mazeHeight at the moment)
1. Assign that variable name a value by connecting a value block to it.
1. Change the value to the width and height (measured in number of tiles)
1. If you choose values that are too large, they will not be accepted.
1. Create an empty maze, which will have its width and height set according to the variables you set.

So, to set width to 16 and height to 12, it would look like this.
