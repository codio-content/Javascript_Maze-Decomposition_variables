This next example shows how variables can be really useful. We are going to stick to Javascript.

We want to create 3 monsters, 3 walls and 3 energy stores. 

- Notice how we have now only had to define a single variable called `numElements`.
- Look at the functions. We have used the same variable in each case because we want the same value to be used. 

## Play
1. Try changing the value from 3 to something else less than 20.
2. See what happens when you make a deliberate mistake. For instance `numElements = *&^` or `numElements =`.

The error you got if you tried the second is known as a syntax error. 

Programming languages have something called *syntax*. This is a set of rules you need to follow so it can understand you.

In a spoken language, this is similar to spelling and grammar.

If you get a syntax error, you will need to correct it before your program will run properly. Correct your code so it runs as expected.
