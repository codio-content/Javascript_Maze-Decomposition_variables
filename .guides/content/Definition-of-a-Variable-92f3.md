A variable is named placeholder for a value and that value can change over time.

Here some examples of variable names and show values being assigned to them.

- mazeWidth = 40
- mazeHeight = 30
- numberOfMonsters = 4
- X = 5
- Y = 12

These values can be changed at any time. 

Other parts of your program can inspect what value a variable contains and then use that value to do something.

If we set `mazeWidth = 30` and then call a function `updateMaze()`, the game can look at the variable `mazeWidth` and adjust the size from it.

We'll now start playing around with variables.
