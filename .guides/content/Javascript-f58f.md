Coding the same thing in Javascript is really easy. Take a look on the left hand side and you can see how we do it.

## Experiment
Try a few things out by changing the code and see what happens

1. Change values that are assigned to the variables.
1. Change variable names (be sure to change them in both places)
1. See what happens if you change the variable name where you assign the value to it but not where you use it as an argument to a function.
