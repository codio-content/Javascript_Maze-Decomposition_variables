Now let's do the exact same thing in Javascript. In fact, it is quite a lot quicker and easier that using blocks.

If you look on the left, you can see we have got an example working. 

## Assigning a value to a variable
This is very simple indeed.

```javascript
mazeWidth = 10
```

Note that variable names cannot have spaces in them. So, `mazeWidth` is correct, whereas `maze Width` would give an error.

## Create Maze function
Here you can see how we are calling another function `createMaze()` that generates the maze. This function checks to see what values are contained in `mazeWidth` and `mazeHeight` and create the maze size accordingly.
