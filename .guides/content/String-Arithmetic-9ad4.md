Remember how we did number arithmetic?

```javascript
myVariable = 100
myOtherVariable = myVariable + 10
```

In this case, `myOtherVariable` will be 110.

With strings, we can do semething similar. Take a look at the code on the left hand side.

Here we are creating 2 variables, `firstName` and `LastName`. We are then adding these together to give another string `fullName` the other variables joined together.

## Play 
Play with the code on the left and do your own experiments.

## Another example
You can use as many `+` as you like. Look at this example.

```javascript
string1 = 'A'
string2 = 'B'
string3 = 'C'
showMessage(string1 + string2 + string3)
```

You would see `ABC` in the game message bar when this runs.
