We can use variables for creating our monsters, walls and energy stores.

In the previous Unit we used the following functions

- `addRandomMonsters()`
- `addRandomWalls()`
- `addRandomEnergies()`
- `addPlayer()`

All of these functions, except `addPlayer()` take one single argument, which is the number of entities to add.

Your job is to use a single variable, which you can call anything you like and assign it a value of 3. Then use this variable in all of the functions to generate the same number of Monsters, Walls and Energies.

Add a player as well. Don't forget to create an empty maze as the first instruction.
