We can use variables for creating our monsters, walls and energy stores.

This time, we are going to use a new approach and you will be choosing your own variable names.

We'll start off by using blocks again. Look at the blocks on the left. We are doing the following

## Adding Energy Stores
We have created 2 energy stores at random locations using 'Add Random Energy' with a value of 2 plugged in directly.

## Adding Walls
We could could have done exactly the same thing to create the walls. Instead, we are going to use a variable first and then use that variable. So ...

1. We are creating a variable that we happen to have called `numWalls` and we have assigned that variable a value of 8.
1. We now use the Add Walls instruction but instead of pluggin a value, we are going to plug in the variable.

Take a look at the game and see if you are sure what's going on.
