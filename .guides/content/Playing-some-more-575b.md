## Play 

Let's play around with this example a little more.

1. Change the variable name to something else **but** make sure your variable name does not have spaces or characters other than letters.
1. In the 'Create Maze' function call, make sure that you change the variable name to be the same variable you used in step 1.

## Create Energy Stores the same way
Now, modify the blocks so that the energy stores are created using a variable rather than a literal number.

1. Choose your variable name to be something sensible (no spaces).
1. Modify the Add Energy command to use the same variable name.
